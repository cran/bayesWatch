Description: Bayes Watch fits an array of Gaussian Graphical Mixture Models to groupings of homogeneous data in time, called regimes, which are modeled as the observed states of a Markov process with unknown transition probabilities.  In doing so, Bayes Watch defines a posterior distribution on a vector of regime assignments, which gives meaningful expressions on the probability of every possible change-point.  Bayes Watch also allows for an effective and efficient fault detection system that assesses what features in the data where the most responsible for a given change-point.
